The source code files in this directory are supposed to be compiled
in the source_c directory of Tisean and were developed in an archive
that has been downloaded from the Tisean web page on May 15 2014.

Patching with tisean_cec.h.patch is required for histogram.c.

A mostly identical version of histogram is available on github.
